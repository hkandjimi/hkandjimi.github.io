  abstract          = {In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

abstract={Problem-solving skills are an integral component within the computer science field. Due to the diversity brought about by students following different learning and programming behaviours, it is challenging to track and identify when students get overwhelmed while writing programs. When students are overwhelmed, they are unable to complete learning objectives on time and follow prescribed pathways, depriving them of the opportunity to learn new concepts. In this paper, we developed and evaluated the quality of Markov models that encode student programming behaviours based on the evolution of source code submissions during formative practical assignments. In doing so, we use Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) extracted from the source code, which are used for clustering similar submissions and tracking students' progressive approaches within the Markov models. An approach based on MinHashLSH is presented that works on AST nodes as input to emphasise structural similarity and related programming approaches. As such, the effectiveness of the Modified MinHashLSH approach is based on the clusters that make up the Markov model.},

  abstract    = {Child-based disappearances; abuse and suicides are still a predominant dilemma in Namibia, with the majority of the cases resulting from poor parental supervision. Accordingly, there is a need for alternative ways to supervise children, especially during outdoor activities where the chances of them wandering far from home are quite high. The immediate objective of this research was to design and develop an android-based supervisory tracking system for children in Namibia, as a means to improve parental supervision. In addition to the geo-tracking component, an audio sentiment analysis features to predict the likely hood of depression signs in children was integrated.
                 This study used spatial data, like global position system (GPS) coordinates and utilized text-based data provided by Google’s speech-to-text feature. The GPS coordinates were captured using an inbuilt GPS module within the tracking device.

Traditional and common methods of collecting data are manual and take up employees productive time to complete. There is a solution that can help automate this process.
                 This study explores the implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) models in an automated emotion and attendance system. The system is designed in such a way that companies can generate employee's mood/emotion data by facial recognition through a customized Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The companies can place a camera on the entering and exit of each Block/Floor. Cameras can capture the image and provide input to OpenCV for easy integration and taking attendance. The captured image can further be used for mood detection and store in the database for each employee. The Human Resources (HR) department can track feedback from employee's facial expressions on the same day for social events, hikes, seminars, and new initiatives. }

In most cases visitors’ experience is highly enhanced if they get a detailed knowledge on each artefact from the museum guides and this is critical to user satisfaction; however the ratio of human guides to visitors is always grossly inadequate. The purpose of this study was to look at alternative ways to enhance visitors’ experience and satisfaction using latest wireless technologies in smart phones by providing video, audio and text format information of an iBeacon-targed artefact. A qualitative research approach followed by a constructive design, development and implementation was used in this study, with the main objective of producing an indoor location-aware interactive virtual guide prototype application that has sufficient usability qualities including ease of use, usefulness and stable transactions. This study was contextualized to Namibian museums using the Independence Memorial Museum as a test case.},
