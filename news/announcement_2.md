After a careful review process by the reviewers in our Program Committee, your paper has been ACCEPTED for publication in the  SAICSIT CCIS Springer proceedings." :relieved: what a a relieve, the paper got 2 accepts and a weak accepts.

Will be working on the comments from the reviewers and suggested corrections. Most review comments are so insightful but some are quite brutal :grin:. However, this comes with the territory I believe.
