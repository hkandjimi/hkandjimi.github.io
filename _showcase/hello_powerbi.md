*Creating a Business Report:* step-by-step process of creating a complete business report using Power BI, from loading sample data to formatting visuals and sharing the report with others.

*Power BI Interface:* the main areas of the Power BI interface, including the ribbon, canvas, panels, and switching panel, and how to use these areas to construct and navigate reports.

*Building Visuals:* how to create various types of visuals, such as column charts, bar charts, and slicers, and how to format and customize these visuals to display data effectively.

*Publishing and Sharing Reports:* the process of saving, publishing, and sharing Power BI reports, including the benefits of using the Power BI online platform for collaboration and data updates.
