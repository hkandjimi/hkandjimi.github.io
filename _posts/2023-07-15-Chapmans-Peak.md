Saturday drive trying to kill time and see places around Cape Town, was interested in the Chapman's Peak drive so decided to mimic the 2 oceans marathon path. Very scenic drive and full of parking spots on the sides for photos but unfortunate for me I didn't do much of that.

## A few random pictures
Below are a few random pictures taken on the drive, could have done better and most especially provide improved quality with better equipment.
